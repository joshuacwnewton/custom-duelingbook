# Custom Duelingbook

This fork aims to make the userscript easier for me to edit. I wish to add new macro functions, however it is a >3500 line script. I want to [split it into multiple files](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10492560) based on functionality. 

This fork is designed for my own personal usage only. I do not wish to maintain this script for others. I'm just trying to make it easier for me to play Edison. :)

## Installation

- Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your Browser.
- Then, open the [Custom DB Script](https://github.com/killburne/custom-duelingbook/raw/master/custom-duelingbook.user.js) and click install.
- After this go to [Duelingbook](https://www.duelingbook.com/) and you'll see in the bottom left corner a button to open the settings to customize it to your liking

## Hotkeys

- ``F2`` (you can also configure this in the settings): opens the ruling database entry for the current card in the detailed view

## Macros
Using the macro function you can do many things, for example:
- Send a message in chat
- Add cards from the Deck to your hand
- Special Summon monsters from the Deck in Attack/Defense Position and either open the zone chooser or just Summon it to a random zone.
- Send a card from the Deck to the GY

### Syntax
- Categories: ``-- My Category Name``
- Macros: ``Button Name | message to send``
- Multiple actions in one Macro: ``Button name | message 1 | message 2 | message 3``
- Variables: ``${variableName}``
- Functions: ``${functionName(param)}``
- Functions with multiple parameters: ``${functionName(param1~param2~param3)}``
